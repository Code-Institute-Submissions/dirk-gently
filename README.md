# Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency

Dirk Gently is a fictional character created by Douglas Adams (1952-2001). He features 
in Adams' books <em>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</em> (William Heinemann Ltd., 1987), 
<em>The Long, Dark Teatime of the Soul</em> (William Heinemann Ltd., 1988) and <em>The Salmon of Doubt</em> 
(Macmillan, 2002), and in the Netflix series based on the books.

The website advertises Dirk Gently's unique services. He believes in the interconnectedness 
of all things, which leads him to add unexpected items to clients' bills. He compensates 
for this with his willingness to go to extreme lengths to investigate clients' cases and 
his refusal to rule out anything, no matter how outlandish, until the case has been solved.

## UX

### User Stories
#### I want to find out quickly if the company offers the service I want.
The home page outlines the company's philosophy and the Services page give examples of the services offered. 
The text is brief and to the point. At the top of each page, there are links to all other pages.

#### I want to know if I can trust this company.
The About page gives brief biographies of the agency's staff, outlining their experience.

#### I want to contact the company easily.
Contact details and social media links are in the footer of each page, and there is a simple contact form on the Contact page.


### Design

[Click here to see the wireframe of the website](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dFBdKboGSMnJ1-ukDbQcDlBI7GNdjFE_/view?usp=sharing).

The mood of the website is mysterious but reassuring. The shades of blue convey calmness, while
brown conveys warmth and orange conveys energy. 

## Features

### Existing Features
- Concise descriptions of what the agency does allows users to find out quickly if it's the agency they need.
- Links in the header of each page allow users to navigate between the pages.
- Social media links in the footer of each page allow users to visit the agency's profiles on Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter.
- The form on the Contact page allows users to send requests to the agency.

### Features Left to Implement
- JavaScript can be used to make the form send emails. However, this is out of the scope of this project.
- The social media icons do not currently link to any social media profiles.


## Technology Used

This is a front-end only website, using HTML5 and CSS3. In addition, I used the following:

- **[Balsamiq for Google Drive](https://balsamiq.com/)** was used to create wireframes.

- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** was used for icons and to simplify the layout and responsiveness.

## Testing
- Checked the HTML with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Checked the CSS with the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- Clicked all nav links to ensure that they go to the correct pages
- Attempted to submit the form without filling in the fields to ensure that it prompts the user to fill in the form before submitting
- Checked the site on the full range of screen sizes to ensure that it is fully responsive

## Deployment

I deployed the project to GitHub as folows: 

1. I navigated to the repository in GitHub.
2. I clicked on Settings
3. I scrolled down to GitHub Pages and selected the master branch as the source 
4. I clicked Save. 

The procedure worked without any errors, and there are no differences between the deployed version and the development version.
