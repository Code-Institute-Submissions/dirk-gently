# Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency
Dirk Gently is a fictional character created by Douglas Adams (1952-2001). He features 
in Adams' books Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, The Long, Dark Teatime 
of the Soul and The Salmon of Doubt (unfinished at the time of Adams' death), and 
in the Netflix series based on the books.

## The Concept
The website advertises Dirk Gently's unique services. He believes in the interconnectedness 
of all things, which leads him to add unexpected things to clients' bills. He compensates 
for this with his willingness to go to extreme lengths to investigate clients' cases and 
his refusal to rule out anything, no matter how outlandish, until the case has been solved.

## The Design
The mood of the website is mysterious but reassuring. The shades of blue convey calmness, while
brown conveys warmth and orange conveys energy. It has minimal text content in order to avoid 
limiting the range of services offered. It gives just enough information to let clients know 
if the kind of service on offer is right for them.

## Technology Used
The website was created with the aid of Bootstrap version 3.3.7. It is a front-end only website, using 
HTML5 and CSS3. The header, footer and contact form are partly based on code from the User Centric Frontend 
Development mini-project and the text containers are partly based on code from "Bootstrapping Your Next Big Idea". 
I adapted the styles to fit in with the design of my site.
