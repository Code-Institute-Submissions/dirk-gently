# Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency

Dirk Gently is a fictional character created by Douglas Adams (1952-2001). He features 
in Adams' books <em>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</em> (William Heinemann Ltd., 1987), 
<em>The Long, Dark Teatime of the Soul</em> (William Heinemann Ltd., 1988) and <em>The Salmon of Doubt</em> 
(Macmillan, 2002), and in the Netflix series based on the books.

The website advertises Dirk Gently's unique services. He believes in the interconnectedness 
of all things, which leads him to add unexpected items to clients' bills. He compensates 
for this with his willingness to go to extreme lengths to investigate clients' cases and 
his refusal to rule out anything, no matter how outlandish, until the case has been solved.

## UX

### User Stories
#### I want to find out quickly if the company offers the service I want.
The home page outlines the company's philosophy and the Services page give examples 
of the services offered. The text is brief and to the point. At the top of each 
page, there are links to all other pages.

#### I want to know if I can trust this company.
The About page gives brief biographies of the agency's staff, outlining their 
experience.

#### I want to contact the company easily.
Contact details and social media links are in the footer of each page, and there 
is a contact form on the Contact page.


### Design

To view the wireframe of the website, please [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dFBdKboGSMnJ1-ukDbQcDlBI7GNdjFE_/view?usp=sharing) 
and then click "Open with Balsamiq Wireframes" at the top of the page. 
It may take a few seconds for "Open with Balsamiq Wireframes" to appear.

The logo comprises two magnifying glasses that are mirror images of each other, 
linked to form a venn diagram. This symbolises the agency's belief in the 
interconnectedness of all things

The colour scheme, background image and fonts combine to create a mood that is 
mysterious but reassuring. The shades of blue convey calmness, brown conveys warmth 
and orange conveys energy. 

## Features

### Existing Features
- Concise description of the agency's services allows users to find out quickly 
if it's the agency they need.
- Links in the header of each page allow users to navigate between the pages.
- Social media links in the footer of each page allow users to visit the agency's 
profiles on Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter.
- The form on the Contact page allows users to send requests to the agency.

### Features Left to Implement
- JavaScript can be used to make the form send emails. However, this is outside 
the scope of this project.
- Whereas the icons for Facebook, Google+ and Twitter link to fan pages on those 
sites, the LinkedIn icon does not link to anything, as I found nothing suitable 
on LinkedIn. There were a couple of users with Dirk Gently as pseudonyms, but I 
wasn't comfortable linking to their profiles.


## Technologies Used

- **[Balsamiq for Google Drive](https://balsamiq.com/)** was used to create wireframes.

3. Click on the "By direct input" tab
4. Paste the CSS into the box and click "Check"
5. If any errors are found, fix them in the CSS file
- **Site Navigation:** Click the "HOME", "SERVICES", "ABOUT" and "CONTACT" links 
in the navbars of all four pages to ensure that they go to the correct pages
- **Contact Form:** Attempt to submit the form with blank fields to ensure that 
it prompts the user to fill in all fields before submitting
- **Responsivenes:** Check the site on the full range of screen sizes to ensure 
that it is fully responsive

Firefox and Opera to ensure compatiblity with a range of popular browsers

## Deployment

I deployed the project to GitHub as folows: 

1. I pushed my local repository to GitHub.
2. I navigated to the repository in GitHub.
3. I clicked on Settings.

The procedure worked without any errors, and there are no differences between the 
deployed version and the development version.
